# meal-planner

This is my personal project that I will be working on as I complete The Odin Project.

The idea behind it is to have a website that can be accessed by multiple people to have a shared meal plan with recipes linked, and a built in shopping list.

I came up with the idea while my grandma was in the hospital and there was 20-30 people eating dinner at her house every night. Trying to communicate what was being eaten, when, and what needed to be bought was a nightmare.
