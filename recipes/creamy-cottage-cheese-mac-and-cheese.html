        <h1>Creamy Cottage Cheese Mac & Cheese</h1>
        <p>Creamy high protein mac and cheese, made with only 5 ingredients.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz pasta</li>
            <li>1 cup cottage cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pasta water</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil the pasta in salted water until al dente, saving 1/2 cup of pasta water before
                 draining.</li>
            <li>Put the cooked pasta back in the pot. Mix in milk, cottage cheese, cheddar, and 
                garlic powder over low heat  until the cheese melts. Add pasta water gradually to 
                smooth the sauce.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and other spices (paprika, black pepper, onion powder), of desired, 
                to taste. Add more pasta water or milk for a creamier texture.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p><i>Classic elbow macaroni or shells is what waorks best for mac and cheese but any 
            smaller pasta will work: penne, rotini, ziti, campanelle, etc.</i></p>
        <p><i>Pick pasta that fits your dietary restrictions - gluten-free, whole wheat, chickpea, 
            lentil, or brown rice pasta will all work with this recipe.</i></p>
        <p><i>For extra smoothness, blend the sottage cheese in a small food processor or blender 
            before adding to the recipe. But if you're lazy like me, skip the blending - it'll 
            still be  creamy and mostly melted.</i></p>
        <p><i>If your mac and cheese seems dry, add more pasta water or milk (a couple Tbsp at a
            time) and keep mixing gently.</i></p>
        <p><i>A rubber spatula works best for mixing as it won't break the pasta shapes.</i></p>
        <p><i>Feel free to experiment with various types of cheese. Cheddar is my go to but you 
            can also mix in som parmesan, gryuere or gouda.</i></p>
