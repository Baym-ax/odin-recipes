            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups milk, <i>divided</i></li>
            <li>2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice the potatoes, ham, and carrots into half inch, bite-sized pieces. Dice the raw 
                bacon and set it to the side.</li>
            <li>To the crockpot add the ham, carrots, corn, onion, potatoes, bacon, chicken broth, salt, 
                and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cover the crockpot. Cook everything on low for 5-6 hours or on high for 3-4 hours. Check 
                if it is ready by piercing a potato with a fork to see if they are tender.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl combine cornstarch with 1/4 cup of milk. Mix well until cornstarch is 
                dissolved into a slurry mixture.</li>
            <li>Add the cornstarch mixture to the crockpot and mix well. Add 1 1/4 cup of milk to the 
                crockpot and stir. Add the shredded cheese a little at a time, mixing well in between.</li>
            <li>Cover crockpot again. Cook the soup on high for an additional 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add parsley, and some crispy bacon for garnish if desired. Enjoy!</li>
