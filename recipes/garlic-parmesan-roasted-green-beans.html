        <h1>Garlic Parmesan Roasted Green Beans</h1>
        <p></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound green beans, washed and trimmed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>6 large cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt and 1 tsp fresh cracked black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp italian seasoning</li>
            <li>3/4-1 cup grated parmesan</li>
            <li>Fresh chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 F.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine fresh green beans with butter, garlic, parmesan, salt, pepper, 
                and italian seasoning and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Spread the prepared green beans on a baking sheet. Roast the green beans for 15-20 
                minutes until crisp-tender, stirring halfway through.</li>
            <li>Remove parmesan green beans from the oven, transfer to a serving plate, garnish with fresh 
                chopped parsley and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To make your green beans more tender, you can pre-cook green beans in the microwave with 
                1 cup water for 5 minutes, then soak into ice-cold water before mixing with butter, garlic, 
                and parmesan.</li>
            <li>Parmesan is already salty, so go easy on salt at first, then taste and adjust seasoning to 
                your taste.</li>
            <li>If you like your green beans coated with extra crispy parmesan, add up to 1 cup of parmesan 
                to the mixture.</li>
        </ul>
