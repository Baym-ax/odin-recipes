            in a regular oven, air fryer, or cooking pizza on the grill!</p>
        <h2>Eqipment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza Stone</li>
            <li>Pizza Peel</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>2 tsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp white vinegar</li>
            <li>3 3/4 - 4 cups bread flour (all-purpose flour would also work)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Combine Ingredients:</b> In a large bowl of a stand mixer combine 
                   1/2 cup of the warm water with the sugar and yeast. Stir to dissolve 
                   the yeast and let rest for 5 minutes. It should foam on the top. 
                   Add the remaining 1 cup of warm water, olive oil, salt, and vinegar</li>
            <li><b>Knead Dough:</b> Begin mixing on medium-low speed, gradually adding 
                   the flour a cup at a time, and knead the dough for about 7 minutes, 
                   or until it's smooth and elastic. You may not need all of the flour. 
                   The dough should be slightly sticky, but not so sticky that it really 
                   sticks to your fingertip when touched.</li>
            <li><b>Rise:</b> Transfer dough to a greased bowl and cover with a dry towel 
                   or greased plastic wrap. Allow to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until 
                   it has about doubled in volume.</li>
            <li><b>Roll out:</b> Gently punch the dough down and place on a lightly 
                gresaed or floured counter top. Divide dough into 2 or 3 equal pieces 
                (makes about two 14" or three 9" pizzas). Roll and stretch the dough to 
                desired size and thickness. Brush dough with olive oil.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Oven Method:</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (with a pizza stone inside, if you have one). 
            Add cornmeal and flour to a pizza peel or use a pizza pan. Pick the top of 
            the dough a few times with a fork and pre-bake for 3-4 minutes. Remove from 
            oven and add pizza sauce and toppings. Return to oven and bake for 8-15 
            minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly.</p>
        <h3>Pizza Oven Method</h3>
        <p>Add cornmeal and flour to a pizza peel and place rolled out dough on top. 
            Add toppings. Slide into preheated pizza oven and cook according to pizza 
            oven instructions.</p>
        <h3>Air Fryer Method:</h3>
        <p>Roll dough into small sizes that will fit in air fryer. Cook in air fryer for 
            1 minute (check after 30 seconds, to make sure it didn't fold over), then
            flip sides and cook 1 more minute. Repeat with remaining crusts. Add toppings. 
            Cook at 370 for 1-3 minutes or until bubbly.</p>
        <h3>Grill Method:</h3>
        <p>Preheat grill to medium-high. Roll out dough and place on a piece of parchment 
            paper. Spread with oil, then gently flip the pizza onto the grill, oil side 
            down, and peel the parchment paper off. Cover grill lid and cook for 2-3 
            minutes or until grill marks appear on bottom. Flip the pizzas onto a plate 
            and add sauce and toppings to cooked side. Reduce heat and slide pizzas back 
            on the grill to cook another 3-5 minutes.</p>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p><strong>Pre-Bake Dough, if cooking pizza in the oven.</strong> If you're 
            baking the pizza in the oven, whether on a pizza stone or not, always 
            pre-bake the dough for 4-5 minutes before adding toppings, to make sure 
            the dough cooks crisp on the outside and soft and airy in the middle. Once 
            you add the <a href="pizza-sauce.html" target="_blank">Pizza Sauce</a> and 
            toppings, return it to the oven to finish baking.</p>
        <p><b>Make Ahead Instructions:</b> Mix the dough, place in a large greased bowl 
            with a tight lid and refrigerate for several hours, or overnight. Remove from 
            the fridge and allow to come to room temperature so it's easy to roll out. 
            You could also roll-out and pre-bake the dough, add toppings and store in the 
            fridge for a take-and-bake style pizza.</p>
        <p><b>Freezing Instructions:</b> Once the dough is mixed, wrap it in plastic wrap 
            place it in a freezer safe container to freeze for up to 3 months. When ready 
            to that, place it in a greased bowl, covered, in the fridge until completely 
            that (about 24 hours). Allow to come to room temperature so it's easy to roll 
            out. You could also freeze the pre-baked dough, with or without toppings.</p>
