            <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
            <li>Fresh chopped parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add chicken to a saucepan fully submerged in 2 cups of the stock, bring to a boil and then 
                simmer for approx 10-12 minutes until cooked. Drain, remove from pan, allow to cool 
                slightly and then slice up into pieces and set aside.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is poaching, spray a non stick frying pan over a medium-high heat 
                with olive oilspray.</li>
            <li>Add the bacon and fry until evenly golden and crisp. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same frying pan, spray a little more olive oil spray and add the shallot and fry 
                until lightly golden and softened.</li>
            <li>Add in the minced garlic cloves and fry for 30 seconds to infuse the flavor.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining stock, milk, lemon juice, dried herbs, dried seasoning, and laughing 
                cow and whisk until it is all melted into the stock and no visible lumps appear. Mix the 
                cornstarch with a couple of Tbsp of water and add this into the sauce stirring as you do.
                </li>
            <li>Add the poached chicken and uncooked gnocchi, and bring to a boil and then let it bubble on 
                a medium heat for 5 minutes until the gnocchi is cooked and the sauce is creamy and 
                thick. (If sauce is not thickening your heat is too low). Once gnocchi is cooked and 
                sauce is thickened, taste and adjust seasoning with some salt and black pepper if needed.
                </li>
            <li>Transfer to an ovenproof dish and top with the grated cheddar, place in the broiler for 
                a couple of minutes until the cheddar is melted and very lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with the cooked crispy bacon and some chopped fresh parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve, and enjoy!</li>
