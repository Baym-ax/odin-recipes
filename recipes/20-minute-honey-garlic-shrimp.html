        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 tsp fresh ginger, minced (optional)</li>
            <li>1 lb medium uncooked shrimp, peeled & deveined</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>chopped green onion (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk the honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger ( is using) together in a medium bowl. You 
                will use half for the marinade in step 2, and half for cooking the shrimp in step 3.</li>
            <li>Place shrimp in a large sealable container or zipped-top bag. Pour 1/2 of the 
                marinade/sauce mixture on top, give it all a shake or stir, then allow shrimp to marinate 
                in the refrigerator for 15 minutes or for up to 12 hours. Cover and refrigerate the rest 
                of the marinade for step 3.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place shrimp in the skillet. (Discard
                used marinade.) Cook shrimp on one side until pink, about 45 seconds, then flip shrimp 
                over. Pour in remaining marinade/sauce and cook it all until shrimp is cooked through, about 
                1-2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve shrimp with brown rice and steamed vegetables, or over a salad.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want a thicker sauce, mix 1 tsp cornstarch with 1 tsp warm water and stir into the 
                sauce before using it in step 3.</li>
        </ul>
