            for a hearty bowl-style dinner with rice.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground chicken (or turkey)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red onion (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp fresh dill (chopped)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp fresh mint leaves (chopped)</li>
            <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp Greek seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp kosher or sea salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the meatball ingredients: ground chicken, red onion, fresh dill, 
                fresh mint, garlic, Greek seasoning, salt, and pepper. Mix well, until everything comes 
                together.</li>
            <li>Using a medium cookie scoop, shape the meatball mixture into balls and place them on a 
                plate.</li>
            <li><b>Stove Top:</b> Heat a large skillet with oil over medium heat. Add the meatballs in a 
                single layer and cook for 5 minutes. Flip to the other side and continue cooking for an 
                additional 5 minutes, until the meatballs are browned and cooked through.</li>
            <li><b>Oven:</b> Preheat oven to 350 F. Grease a baking tray with cooking spray. Spread out 
                the meatballs, leaving 1" space between them. Pop them into the oven for about 30 minutes, 
                until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Once meatballs are done cooking, transfer the meatballs to a plate, cover with aluminum 
                foil and let rest for 5 minutes. (This helps your meatballs to be juicy!) Then serve as 
                desired!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Store:</b> Place them in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
            <li><b>Reheat:</b> Microwave in 30-second increments until warm. If you're reheating straight 
                from frozen, sprinkle with 3 tsp water anbd microwave for a full minute. Stir them anb 
                microwave for another 2-3 minutes. Or bake at 375 F for about 15 minutes, until warmed 
                through.</li>
            <li><b>Freeze Uncooked Meatballs:</b> Follow the first two steps in the recipe. Place the 
                meatballs on a baking sheet in a single layer and place in the freezer for 30 minutes. 
                Then transfer to a Ziploc bag and store them in the freezer for up to 3 months. To cook, 
                place the frozen meatballs on a baking sheet and cover with foil. Bake at 375 F for 
                approxiamtely 40 minutes or until cooked all the way through.</li>
            <li><b>Sun-Fried Tomatoes:</b> Chop up to 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (the dry ones not in 
                oil), and add them to your chicken mixture.</li>
            <li><b>Lemon:</b> Want to add a lemon twist? Add 1 Tbsp freshly squeezed lemon juice and 1 
                tsp lemon zest.</li>
            <li><b>Spicy:</b> Add red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper, to taste, for a bit of heat.</li>
            <li><b>Cheese Filled:</b> Dice melty cheese like mozzarella into 1/2" cubes and place one in 
                the center of each meatball while shaping. This will create a gooey, cheesy center when 
                cooked.</li>
        </ul>
