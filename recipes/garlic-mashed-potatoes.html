        <ul>
            <li>2 lbs potatoes</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup half-and-half or milk</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Optional: fresh chives or parsley, for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and cut the potatoes into chunks. Place them in a large pot and cover with cold 
                water. Add a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes until they are fork-tender, 15-20 minutes.
                Drain well.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, heat the butter, half-and-half, and minced garlic over medium heat 
                until the butter is melted and the mixture is hot. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Using a potato masher or a hand mixer, mash the potatoes until smooth. Gradually add the 
                hot garlic mixture, stirring until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer the mashed potatoes to a serving bowl and garnish with fresh chives or parsley 
                if desired. Serve hot.</li>
