        <h2>Lasagna</h2>
        <p>A beloved Italian dish, this hearty and comforting meal consists of several layers
            of ingredients baked to perfection. The foundation of this dish is the lasagna
            noodles, flat pasta sheets that form the structural base. Between these layers, 
            you'll find a rich and flavorful meat sauce, made with Italian sausage, ground beef,
             garlic, onion, tomatoes, sugar, and various spices. This creates a deep, 
             savory flavor that's both robust and satisfying.</p>
        <p>The meat sauce is complemented by a creamy cheese mixture, which contains 
            parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta. The cheeses add a delightful creaminess and 
            sharp, tangy contrast to the meat sauce. Fresh parsley and dried basil are 
            added for their aromatic qualities, enhancing the overall taste profile of the dish

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over 
                medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
                Season with sugar, 2 Tbsp parsley, basil, 1 tsp salt, Italian 
                seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for 1 1/2 
                hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna 
                noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, 
                and remaining salt.</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
                baking dish. Arrange 4 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 
                1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese 
                slices. Spoon 1 cup meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 
                cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarells and Parmesan cheese. 
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking 
                spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 
                an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving</li>
        </ol>
